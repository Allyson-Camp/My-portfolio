        <p class="centered-text">"Alexa, play "Beauty School Dropout."</br></p>
        <p>All jokes aside, Hello! I am a full-stack software developer with a background in
          fashion merchandising, makeup artistry, and hair styling
          originally from Dallas, Texas. After graduating from The
          University of North Texas with my bachelors in Fashion
          Merchandising in 2016, I relocated to Portland, Oregon to pursue
          a formal career in the beauty industry. I quickly fell in love
          with hair color theory and upon graduation began my path to
          becoming a color specialist with a focus in color correction and
          creative color.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, after spending over 10 years in the beauty industry I
          knew I wanted to start on a journey to find something I am just
          as passionate about but would provide a more stable work-life
          balance. Enter software development! After the unfortunate
          closure of my first coding bootcamp in January 2023, I was
          determined to keep on my path to becoming an employed developer.
          While I was only 30 days in at the time of the closure, I knew I
          loved software development and would do everything in my power
          to find a new program to guide me along my path. As of July 2023,
          I began a new program at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon and am
          back on track.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background as a hair color specialist and makeup artist has
          taught me how to solve problems using creative solutions. I love
          to learn the rules then having the creative freedom come up with
          my own ways of implementing them while keeping my code clean and
          concise, just as you need to do as a successful colorist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though I left the industries behind I still love all things
          fashion and beauty. In my spare time - when I'm not spending
          time with my fur babies - I enjoy working on hair color projects and
          flexing my creative muscles as much as I can. I've also become a
          lover of all things nature and enjoy filling my space with as many plants and ethical taxidermy as I can.
