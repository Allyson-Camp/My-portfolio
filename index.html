            <p>
                Alexa, play “Beauty School Dropout”. In all seriousness, after
                spending over 10 years in the beauty industry I knew I wanted to
                start on a journey to find something I am just as passionate
                about but would provide a more stable work-life balance. Enter
                software development! My background as a hair color specialist
                and makeup artist has taught me how to solve problems using
                creative solutions. I love to learn the "rules" then come up
                with my own ways of implementing them while keeping my work
                clean and concise - just as you need to do as a successful
                stylist. Having done an apprenticeship for hair and working so
                closely with a master stylist has also prepared me for working
                in a team as a developer, which has been paramount to my success
                up to this point. My time behind the chair also taught me the
                importance of continuing education throughout my career and
                always keeping a thirst for new knowledge. After the unfortunate
                closure of my first coding bootcamp in early 2023 I am
                determined to keep on my path to becoming an employed developer
                and am now continuing my Journey at Epicodus in Portland,
                Oregon.
