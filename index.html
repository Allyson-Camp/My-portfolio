            <h3>About Me</h3>
             <p>
                I am a full-stack software developer with a background in
                fashion merchandising, makeup artistry, and hair styling
                originally from Dallas, Texas. After graduating from The
                University of North Texas with my bachelors in Fashion
                Merchandising in 2016, I relocated to Portland, Oregon to pursue
                a formal career in the beauty industry. I quickly fell in love
                with hair color theory and upon graduation began my path to
                becoming a color specialist with a focus in color correction and
                creative color.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, after spending over 10 years in the beauty industry I
                knew I wanted to start on a journey to find something I am just
                as passionate about but would provide a more stable work-life
                balance. Enter software development! After the unfortunate
                closure of my first coding bootcamp in January 2023, I was
                determined to keep on my path to becoming an employed developer.
                While I was only 30 days in at the time of the closure, I knew I
                loved software development and would do everything in my power
                to find a new program to guide me along my path. As of July 2023,
                I began a new program at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon and am
                back on track.
            </p>

            <p>
                My background as a hair color specialist and makeup artist has
                taught me how to solve problems using creative solutions. I love
                to learn the rules then having the creative freedom come up with
                my own ways of implementing them while keeping my code clean and
                concise, just as you need to do as a successful colorist.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though I left the industries behind I still love all things
                fashion and beauty. In my spare time - when I'm not spending
                time with my fur babies - I enjoy working on hair color projects and
                flexing my creative muscles as much as I can. I've also become a
                lover of all things nature and enjoy filling my space with as many plants and ethical taxidermy as I can.
